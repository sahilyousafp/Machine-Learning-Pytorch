## Overview

These projects demonstrate how to build and train diverse ML models using PyTorch, ranging from basic linear classifiers to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Curriculum includes:

* ‚úÖ Linear regression
* ‚úÖ Rectified (ReLU) models for non-linear separability
* ‚úÖ Multi-class classification
* ‚úÖ Image classification with and without CNN
* ‚úÖ Custom dataset training using TinyVGG architecture
